# word-guessing-game
A small game similar to hangman, made in python.

Game info:
You must guess the hidden word (1 letter per guess)
There is a bomb which will explode after a number of turns (which looks like x~~~~~~~[BOMB])
Have fun
  
Small python project which I created as practice.
Any feedback would be nice!

Thanks, enjoy.
